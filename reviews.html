 Excellent ambience and the burger was first class. I had the Bacon Cheese Burger. YUM!!!Fries bun were homemade.  No preservatives or additives. Coming back again soon. But the real attraction is the place itself.  Come and check it out. -J.Smith

  Sandwich seekers in Surrey should know this is a fun, common-place Café that,in my opinion, makes a name for itself with : neat presentation, top tier customer service and an eclectic environment inside, however customers also have the option of enjoying their meals on small, conventional patio. I will return again soon! -Mary S.

<p>I can't remember the last time we had pizza this good. Stumbled upon this place by chance and would recommend it to everyone. We were greeted by a gentleman(I believe he was the owner) a few minutes before closing - they made amazing pizza and also had great customer service. -Steve B.
